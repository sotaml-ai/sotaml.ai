polls of state of the art on each part of ml area: rotten tomatoes of the AI models (expert opnion: how reproducible? Code shared? Metrics good? vs. practitioner / general public opinion)

Areas of Machine Learning / AI applications include
(From history to state of the art)

* Audio / signal processing (SVS, TTS, ASR, Music genenration)
* Computer Vision
* Recommendation systems
* Reinforcement learning
* Natural language processing
* Drug discovery, genetics, and proteinomics (e.g. Graph neural networks)
* Robotics and Control theory
* Tabular data modeling (e.g. tree based models)
* Time Series Forecasting / Survival Analaysis (e.g. Churn models)
* Mathematical Optimization (maximum entorpy theories, ADAM optimizer, gradient descent, forward forward)
* Fairness, Bias, and Model interpretability
* AI Security and Alignment


# Types of models
* Diffusion generative
* GAN
* Transformer sequential
* Policy / value gradient for reinforceent learning
